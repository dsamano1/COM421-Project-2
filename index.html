        <h2>UX Audit Notes:</h2>
        <a href="https://forms.gle/GkeeyQynAtfcCvrM7" target="_blank">Google form survey of the tasks</a>
        <a href="COM-421 Audit Notes.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Version</a>

        <p>The overall response at the end of the google survey had a consistent pattern of the features the library offers as difficult. 
            Many responses consisted of the website needing more guidance and easier on the eyes for some websites such as the research guide.
            We structured each task for the user to clearly see problems with the website for everyday use or even first time use.
            Many users stated based on their responses that task 3 was the hardest task (58.3%).
            16.6% were not able to finish the given tasks, and 91.7% claimed that they were unaware of library features based on at least one task provided.
            Lastly users, specifically students were asked whether they were aware of the exclusive resource subscriptions offered to them with their myIIT account.
            Due to lack of time it was difficult to survey each student to record their initial reaction towards the library website as they went through the tasks but the responses can be found below for their opinion overall with the website.
